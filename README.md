E. coli Promoter Sequence Detection
This project focuses on computational identification of E. coli promoter sequences using machine learning techniques. The code preprocesses nucleotide data, extracts key features, and trains predictive models to classify sequences as promoters or non-promoters. This tool aims to assist researchers in efficiently analyzing genomic data and understanding transcriptional regulation in E. coli.
